# Cadence

AI-powered calendar app that helps students learn and manage time. The AI agent automatically detects how long tasks take on average and distributes work evenly across available calendar slots.

## Features

- 📅 **Interactive Calendar**: View your schedule in month, week, or day view
- ✅ **Task Management**: Create, edit, and track tasks with priorities and estimated durations
- 🤖 **AI Agent**: 
  - Learns from your task completion times
  - Automatically calculates average durations
  - Distributes tasks across empty calendar slots
  - Prioritizes high-priority tasks first
- 💾 **Data Persistence**: All tasks and events are saved locally in your browser

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## How It Works

1. **Create Tasks**: Add tasks with titles, descriptions, estimated durations, and priorities
2. **Complete Tasks**: When you finish a task, mark it as complete and enter the actual duration
3. **AI Learning**: The AI agent tracks your actual completion times and calculates averages
4. **Auto-Schedule**: Click "Distribute Tasks on Calendar" to automatically schedule all incomplete tasks across available time slots
